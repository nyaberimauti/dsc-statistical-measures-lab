    "Another section down! Let's pull together the statistical measures learned so far to analyze a dataset and produce some business recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recall the concepts and applications of measures of central tendency and dispersion\n",
    "* Practice applying and interpreting measures of central tendency and dispersion\n",
    "* Recall the concepts and applications of covariance and correlation\n",

    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you work for a company that sells widgets<sup>1</sup> and your boss has asked you to look into the sales data across your media markets for this year. She wants to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What sales volume do we have in a typical market?\n",
    "2. How variable are sales across markets?\n",
    "3. If we have 25k more dollars to spend in advertising per market, should we spend it on TV, radio, or newspaper ads?\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>1</sup>*Here we are using the [second definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/widget) of widget: \"an unnamed article considered for purposes of hypothetical example\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab we will be using a popular dataset known as the \"Advertising Dataset\". It comes from [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_](https://statlearning.com) by G. James, D. Witten,  T. Hastie and R. Tibshirani. We have downloaded this dataset for you and stored it in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains four lists. Each number in each list represents the value for that list in a given market. The four lists are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `sales`: the number of widgets sold (in thousands)\n",
    "2. `tv`: the amount of money (in thousands of dollars) spent on TV ads\n",
    "3. `radio`: the amount of money (in thousands of dollars) spent on radio ads\n",
    "4. `newspaper`: the amount of money (in thousands of dollars) spent on newspaper ads\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example:\n",
    "- the **third number** from each list represents the value of `sales`, `tv`, `radio`, and `newspaper` in **one** market,\n",
    "- the **fourth number** from each list represents the value of `sales`, `tv`, `radio`, and `newspaper` in **another** market,\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Sales Data Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code that describes the number of markets a given list has records for, as well as the sales numbers for the markets with the minimum and maximum sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Typical Sales Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a measure of central tendency to describe a \"typical\" market's sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Dispersion of Sales Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a measure of dispersion to describe how variable sales are across markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Correlations between Advertising Expenditure and Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the correlation between TV, radio, and newspaper ad spending and widget sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Where to Spend Additional Dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the findings from step 4 to make a recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sales Data Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, we've opened up the dataset and loaded it into lists named `sales`, `tv`, `radio`, and `newspaper`."
